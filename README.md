# poc-typescript
## This is a simple proof of concept (POC) project. Its objective is to create a basic CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete) application for managing a tasks list using TypeScript.


### Features
- Implemented using TypeScript, with custom installation and configuration.

- Properly typed variables, parameters, functions, etc., with TypeScript, avoiding the use of any.
- API created with Express, featuring at least one involved entity.
- The API includes a complete CRUD for managing tasks, encompassing create, retrieve, update, and delete operations.
- The API is making use of a created database using Postgres with only one table. 

## The table created looks like this: 

| id | name | assignedTo |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | Clean Room | John Doe |
| 2 | Do laundry | Jane Smith |
| 3 | Take out trash | Emily Johnson |
